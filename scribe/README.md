# Scribe

Scribe is a small, messaging oriented encoding library.  It was born out of 
indecision of whether I should use a human-readable encoding scheme or
a binary scheme.   Text is great in that humans can understand and interact
with them, but they are also verbose and less efficient.  Moreover, once tied 
to a particular encoding format, moving to another format can be difficult.  
Scribe offers the vascillators of the world the opportunity to procastinate
further, without harm.
